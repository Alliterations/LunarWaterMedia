## About

LunarWater Media is a game development studio founded by me(Alex Way) during Fall of 2017. Because I had no expereince in programming or making a vidoe game, I heavily relied on developing mods for pre made games, such as, Wolfenstein 3d,Doom,gmod.

Feel free to look around and download a few of my games :-)

## Upcoming Games/Mods
1. NATIVE - Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, a team of militants contain a small zombie outbreak on a small island. After evacuating all of the island's natives, you find one native who hasn't left the island. You start to become closer to the native until the day he asks for a favor...

## Downloads

No games for download ;-(

## Small Talk

Here's to my first website haha,

This section is going to be my blog for now. But anyways, as I'm developing NATIVE, I thought to myself on how I'm going to distribute my game, y'know. I can't tell if I'll be better off using itch.io or just print out a bunch of qr codes to this website and post them all over my school, haha.But Seriously. I have a great fear of failure and I don't LunarWater being buried in a mass burial. I want things to stick.

But, oh man, it's getting late. I'm calling it quits. I'll see you guys on my next blog post!
