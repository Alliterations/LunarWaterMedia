### About

LunarWater Media is a game development studio founded by me(Alex Way) during Fall of 2017. I was heavily inspired by DOOM/Duke Nukem and their mechanics so I've decided to make a DOOM/Duke Nukem styled game using the BUILD engine. 

Feel free to look around and download a few of my games :-)

### Upcoming Games
1. NATIVE - Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, a team of militants contain a small zombie outbreak on a small island. After evacuating all of the island's natives, you find one native who hasn't left the island. You start to become closer to the native until the day he asks for a favor...
